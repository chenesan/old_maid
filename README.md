Old_Maid
========

It's the homework on the class System Programming.
This project stimulates the card game "old maid".

There are 3 programs:organizer,judge and player.The organizer forks the judges, telling the judges how many games to play.Then,the judge forks the players to start the card game.Using pipe and FIFO to communiacte between different program.

Now it's just the first version, I will refactor the code to make it more readable!
